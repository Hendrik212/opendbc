MQTT Data Extraction for Hyundai Ioniq 6

âœ… VERIFIED CAN Messages (captured during charging session 24% -> 31%, 129km -> 164km):

- 0x2fa (762, Bus 1): Battery SOC AND Range - BOTH in ONE message!
  * Byte 15: Battery SOC - Divide by 2 for percentage (0.5% resolution)
    - Example: 48 / 2 = 24.0%, 61 / 2 = 30.5%
    - Verified progression: 24.0% -> 24.5% -> 25.0% -> 25.5% -> 26.0% -> 26.5% -> 28.0% -> 28.5% -> 29.0% -> 30.5%

  * Bytes 30-31: Estimated Range - 16-bit little-endian, divide by 4 (0.25 km resolution)
    - Example: 0x0223 (547) / 4 = 136.75 km, 0x029C (668) / 4 = 167.00 km
    - Verified progression: 136.75 -> 137.00 -> 138.00 -> 138.50 ... -> 167.00 km
    - Monotonically increasing, higher precision than 0x2b5
