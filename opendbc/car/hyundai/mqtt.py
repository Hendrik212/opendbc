MQTT Data Extraction for Hyundai Ioniq 6

âœ… VERIFIED CAN Messages (captured during charging session 24% -> 31%, 129km -> 164km):

- 0x2fa (762, Bus 1): Battery SOC and Charging Metrics
  * Byte 15: Battery SOC - Divide by 2 for percentage (0.5% resolution)
    - Example: 48 / 2 = 24.0%, 61 / 2 = 30.5%
    - Verified progression: 24.0% -> 24.5% -> 25.0% -> 25.5% -> 26.0% -> 26.5% -> 28.0% -> 28.5% -> 29.0% -> 30.5%

  * Bytes 4-5: Pack voltage (16-bit little-endian, 0.1V resolution)
    - Example: 0x104F (4175) * 0.1 = 417.5V
    - Verified range: 417.5V - 417.6V during AC charging

  * Bytes 8-9: Charging current (16-bit little-endian signed, 0.2A resolution)
    - Negative values in CAN indicate charging current
    - Example: 0xFFE8 (-24) * -0.2 = 4.8A charging
    - Verified range: 4.4A - 5.0A during 2kW AC charging session

  * Bytes 24-25: Charging time remaining (16-bit little-endian, minutes)
    - Example: 0x0582 (1410) = 1410 minutes = 23.5 hours
    - Verified progression: 1410 -> 1400 -> 1380 -> 1350 -> 1320 -> 1270 minutes (decreasing as expected)

- 0x2b5 (693, Bus 1): Estimated Range and Charging Status
  * Bytes 8-9: Range in kilometers (16-bit little-endian, direct value)
    - Verified progression during charging: 129 -> 130 -> 131 -> 132 -> 136 -> 142 -> 144 -> 160 km
    - Monotonically increasing (never drops) - cleanest signal
    - Example: 0x81 0x00 = 129 km, 0xA0 0x00 = 160 km

  * Byte 4 bit 0: Charging status flag
    - Bit = 1: Charging handshake/idle
    - Bit = 0: Charging active
