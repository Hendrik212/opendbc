MQTT Data Extraction for Hyundai Ioniq 6

âœ… VERIFIED CAN Messages (captured during charging session 24% -> 31%, 129km -> 164km):

- 0x2fa (762, Bus 1): Battery SOC
  * Byte 15: Battery SOC - Divide by 2 for percentage
  * Example: 48 / 2 = 24.0%, 61 / 2 = 30.5%
  * Verified progression: 24.0% -> 24.5% -> 25.0% -> 25.5% -> 26.0% -> 26.5% -> 28.0% -> 28.5% -> 29.0% -> 30.5%

- 0x2b5 (693, Bus 1): Estimated Range
  * Bytes 8-9: Range in kilometers (16-bit little-endian, direct value)
  * Verified progression during charging: 129 -> 130 -> 131 -> 132 -> 136 -> 142 -> 144 -> 160 km
  * Monotonically increasing (never drops) - cleanest signal
  * Example: 0x81 0x00 = 129 km, 0xA0 0x00 = 160 km
